# Problem Statement

The traditional approach to rewards programs often lacks engagement and fails to unleash the full potential of users. Many users are unaware of the benefits and rewards they can earn through their spending habits. Additionally, they may lack the motivation to actively participate in rewards programs. There is a need for an innovative solution that combines gamification and personalized recommendations to engage users, promote healthy spending habits, and maximize their rewards.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an app-based gamified solution that unlocks the potential of rewards for users. The solution aims to address the following:

1. Engagement: Create an engaging and informative platform that motivates users to actively participate in challenges and games related to their spending habits.

2. Awareness: Educate users about the breadth and significance of rewards programs, showcasing how they can earn rewards through different categories of spending.

3. Personalization: Utilize machine learning models to analyze users' spending habits and provide personalized recommendations to maximize their rewards based on their preferences and interests.

4. Social Sharing: Enable users to share their achievements, rewards, and position on leaderboards with their social networks, promoting peer learning and engagement within their circle.

## Methodology

1. App Development: Develop a mobile application that incorporates various gamified features, including challenges, daily challenges, monthly analysis, AmexGo, and RewardBuddy.

2. Gamified Challenges: Create a variety of engaging and informative challenges and mini-games that are relevant to different spending categories (fitness, food, shopping) to encourage users to participate actively.

3. Personalized Recommendation System: Implement a machine learning model to analyze users' spending habits and provide personalized recommendations for maximizing rewards.

4. Social Sharing Integration: Integrate social media platforms into the app to allow users to share their achievements, rewards, and monthly analysis with their friends and followers.

5. Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard system that recognizes and appreciates users based on their overall spends, rewards collection, good credit scores (CIBIL), referrals, social sharing, and other relevant factors.

## Scope of the Solution

The proposed solution provides an interactive and gamified platform that encourages users to actively engage in their rewards programs. It educates them about the benefits of such programs and provides personalized recommendations to maximize their rewards. The app also promotes social sharing and peer learning, creating a community of users focused on healthy spending habits. The solution aims to increase user awareness, engagement, and rewards accumulation.

## Additional Details

The app will feature a visually appealing interface with exciting graphics and user-friendly navigation. It will leverage location-based services to guide users to nearby stores for in-store rewards. The monthly analysis feature will provide users with insights into their spending patterns and rewards earned. The gamified challenges will require users to perform specific actions to claim rewards, ensuring active participation. The app will employ a hint-based navigation system to guide users through additional tasks and alert them about potential rewards. The integration of machine learning models will enable personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience and maximizing rewards.
